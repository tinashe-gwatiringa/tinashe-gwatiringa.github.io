Team Octobot proudly presents their meticulously crafted walking robot.

In our fourth year of Mechatronic Engineering studies, our team of four embarked on an exciting project: designing and building a walking robot with the ability to follow a line and launch a projectile. This task came with its set of challenges, notably the constraints of size, weight, and budget. These limitations meant that we had to focus on thoughtful design and implementation, opting to create our subsystems rather than relying on pre-built components.

One of the critical functionalities of our robot was its ability to detect a flashing race light and determine when it entered the zone to halt and launch the projectile. This required meticulous sensor integration and programming to ensure precise execution.

Despite the challenges, our robot, named OCTO8OT, performed admirably during the final race. While footage of our victory unfortunately got lost, we were proud of our achievement, finishing the race in the fastest time. Additionally, our robot demonstrated solid performance in launching the projectile, securing a commendable placement.

Although our journey was not without hurdles, the experience was invaluable, allowing us to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world engineering challenges. You can watch a video of our robot in action during practice on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/CE4dbYZDuOY).
