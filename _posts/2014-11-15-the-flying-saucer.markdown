During our third year of Mechatronic Engineering, our team of four aspiring engineers embarked on an exhilarating project: designing and building a hovercraft. The result was a unique creation we fondly named "*The Flying Saucer*".

"The Flying Saucer" faced its ultimate test in a thrilling race. With the Saucer leading the pack for a significant portion of the race, victory seemed within grasp. However, a sudden battery dislodgment dashed our hopes, allowing another team to snatch victory from us in the final moments.

While our team didn't achieve the podium finish we had hoped for, the experience taught us invaluable lessons about turning ideas into reality.
